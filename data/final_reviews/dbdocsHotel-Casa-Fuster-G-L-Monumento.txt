Hotel name: Hotel Casa Fuster G L Monumento 

Hotel name:  The hotel Casa Fuster, housed in a modernist building, offers luxurious rooms with classic décor. Guests praise the friendly and helpful staff, comfortable beds, and delicious breakfast. The rooftop terrace with stunning city views and the hotel's convenient location near attractions like Casa Batllo and Casa Mila are highlights. However, some guests found the rooms to be small and in need of renovation, and there were occasional issues with shower functionality and cleanliness. Additionally, the rooftop pool is small and more suitable for cooling off rather than swimming. Despite these minor drawbacks, many guests highly recommend Casa Fuster for its charm, comfort, and excellent service.
