Hotel name: Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup 

Hotel name:  The Catalonia Ramblas hotel in Barcelona received mixed reviews from guests. While its central location near La Ramblas and other attractions was highly praised, several guests were disappointed with the overall value for money. Complaints included expensive breakfast options, small and poorly designed rooms, and a lack of basic amenities like complimentary water and slippers. The hotel's pool was also a point of contention, with some guests finding it too small and others disappointed that it wasn't heated as advertised.
