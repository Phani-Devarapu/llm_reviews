Hotel name: HCC Regente 

Hotel name:  Overall, the hotel received mixed reviews from guests. While its location was consistently praised for being central and convenient, several aspects of the hotel fell short of expectations. Positive comments highlighted the helpfulness of the front desk staff, cleanliness of the rooms, and the rooftop terrace with excellent views. However, many guests mentioned issues with room comfort, such as uncomfortable beds, lack of soundproofing, and poor air conditioning. Complaints were also raised regarding the limited breakfast options, high prices for certain services, and inconsistent Wi-Fi connectivity. Some guests also expressed disappointment with the views from their rooms, particularly those facing walls or air conditioning units. Despite these criticisms, the hotel's prime location appears to be its strongest selling point.
