Hotel name: Hotel Ronda Lesseps 

Hotel name:  The hotel received mixed reviews from guests. While some praised its location near a metro station, supermarkets, and Parc Guell, others found it noisy and lacking privacy due to glass bathroom doors. The rooms were generally considered good-sized and clean, but some guests complained about maintenance issues, power cuts, and uncomfortable beds. The hotel staff received mixed reviews, with some guests finding them friendly and helpful, while others felt they were not well-trained or provided poor customer service. The breakfast was a point of contention, with some guests finding it varied and good, while others thought it was terrible. Overall, the hotel seems to offer a convenient location and comfortable rooms, but it may need improvements in maintenance, staff training, and breakfast quality to fully satisfy guests.
