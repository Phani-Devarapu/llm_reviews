Hotel name:  The hotel received mixed reviews from guests. While some praised the comfortable beds, cleanliness, and friendly staff, others found the rooms to be small, outdated, and in need of maintenance. The location was also a point of contention, with some guests appreciating the quiet residential area and proximity to Park Guell, while others found it to be too far from the city center and public transportation. The rooftop pool was a popular amenity, but some guests found it to be too small and crowded.
